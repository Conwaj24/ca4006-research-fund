To interact with the funding agency, write commands to the named pipe "fund_pipe"
	e.g. echo apply ABC 200001

or use the send_message script
	e.g. ./send_message withdraw 15 ABC 'John Smith'

Command list:

	apply <research group name> <funding amount at the end, a number>
	withdraw <amount> <group name> <researcher name>
	add_researcher <group name> <researcher name>
	add_description <group name> <description> (description can be space separated, no need for quotation marks)
	get_description <group name>
	add_title <group name> <title>
	get_title <group name>

Note: You'll need to run `make` in detached mode with "&" if you wish to use a single terminal window. Otherwise, open a second window and navigate to the same directory to send commands to the program.
